# Work-Day-Scheduler
challenge 5

## Description
In this webpage build we modifided a built webpage to make it work better for the user. First we made sure there was enough rows to incompass a standard 9-5 work day. Then, when the user inputs something onto the schedule it is stored in localStorage when they click the save button. We also wanted to add some color coding to show the user if thier schedule is in the past, present, or future relative to their current time. This was possible by using Dayjs. Linking to jQuery we could use it for most of our javascript needs. Finally, we wanted the user to see what day their were on for their schedule at the top of the page. Using another Dayjs method we were able to add the day and date to the top of the page.
